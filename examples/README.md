# Picture Examples

Two examples to demonstrate what the script does.

Both examples use the same set of receipe cards but use a different sheet of paper for the black background.

For best results, use a contrasting background color. In the examples below, I used a black background because the receipe cards are white.

## Example 1

The background of this image is too shiny. This makes it hard for the script to find the edge of each receipe card.

## Example 2

This image has a flat black background allowing the script to find all three receipe cards.
